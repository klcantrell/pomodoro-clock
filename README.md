# Spinning Pomodoro

Work in productive bursts with a little help from the timer that animates to let you know how much time you have left.

This app helps users implement the pomodoro technique, which recommends breaking work into short, productive intervals usually 25 minutes long. The interface not only numerically displays the remaining time, but it also animates different parts of the app to show the user the remaining time. If the user wishes to customize the timer, they can use the app's controls to set custom work and break intervals.

User can:

* Start a 25 minute pomodoro and the timer will turn off once 25 minutes has elapsed
* Reset the clock for the next pomodoro
* Customize the length of each pomodoro

Tech Highlights:

* Used animation library **KUTE.js** to visually convey time remaining
* Used **ES2015 classes** to encapsulate main timer and break timer functionality
